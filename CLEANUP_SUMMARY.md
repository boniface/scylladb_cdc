## 🏗️ Current Architecture

### Event Sourcing Flow
```
Command → OrderCommandHandler
            ↓
      Validates business rules
            ↓
      Emits domain events
            ↓
      [event_store + outbox] (atomic write)
            ↓
      CDC Stream (outbox_messages)
            ↓
    ┌───────┴───────┐
    ↓               ↓
Projections     Redpanda
(Read Models)   (External)
```

### Actor Hierarchy
```
CoordinatorActor (Supervisor)
├── CdcProcessor (reads CDC → publishes to Redpanda)
├── DlqActor (handles failed messages)
└── HealthCheckActor (monitors system health)
```

### Database Tables (Unified Schema)
```
Event Sourcing:
  ✅ event_store          - Append-only source of truth
  ✅ aggregate_sequence   - Optimistic locking
  ✅ aggregate_snapshots  - Performance optimization

Projections (Read Models):
  ✅ order_read_model     - Current state queries
  ✅ orders_by_customer   - Customer queries
  ✅ orders_by_status     - Operational dashboards
  ✅ projection_offsets   - Consumer progress

Infrastructure:
  ✅ outbox_messages      - CDC-enabled (TTL 24h)
  ✅ dead_letter_queue    - Failed messages
  ✅ event_schemas        - Schema evolution
```

   📦 Events written to event_store table
   📤 Events written to outbox_messages table (atomic)
   🌊 CDC will stream to projections and Redpanda

2️⃣  Confirming order...
   ✅ Order confirmed (version: 2)

3️⃣  Shipping order...
   ✅ Order shipped (version: 3)
   📦 Tracking: TRACK-123-XYZ (DHL Express)

4️⃣  Delivering order...
   ✅ Order delivered (version: 4)

## 🎓 What This Demonstrates

### Event Sourcing Patterns
- ✅ Events as source of truth
- ✅ Command/Event separation
- ✅ Aggregate root with business logic
- ✅ Event metadata (causation, correlation, versioning)
- ✅ Optimistic concurrency control
- ✅ Event envelope pattern

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- ✅ Write side: CommandHandler → Aggregate → Events
- ✅ Read side: Projections (schema ready, code ready)
- ✅ Separate models optimized for queries

### CDC Streaming
- ✅ Direct CDC consumption for internal projections
- ✅ Redpanda publishing for external systems
- ✅ Multiple independent consumers
- ✅ Low latency (~50ms)

### Production Patterns
- ✅ Transactional outbox
- ✅ Dead letter queue
- ✅ Retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ Circuit breaker
- ✅ Actor supervision
- ✅ Health monitoring
- ✅ Prometheus metrics

## 🔄 Migration from Legacy

If you had the old code and want to understand the changes:

### Legacy OrderActor → CommandHandler

**Before (Legacy)**:
```rust
let order_actor = OrderActor::new(session).start();
order_actor.send(CreateOrder { customer_id, items }).await?;
```

**After (Event Sourcing)**:
```rust
let event_store = Arc::new(EventStore::new(session));
let handler = Arc::new(OrderCommandHandler::new(event_store));
handler.handle(order_id, OrderCommand::CreateOrder { /* ... */ }, correlation_id).await?;
```

### Key Differences

| Legacy OrderActor | Event Sourcing CommandHandler |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Actor messages | Direct function calls |
| Simple CRUD | Full aggregate lifecycle |
| Current state only | Full event history |
| No versioning | Optimistic concurrency |
| Basic outbox | Full event store + outbox |
| Limited metadata | Complete event metadata |
