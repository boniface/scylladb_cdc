# Phase 4 Implementation Summary: Actor Refinement

## What Changed

Phase 4 adds **production-grade actor supervision** with health monitoring, circuit breakers, and graceful shutdown capabilities.

## Key Additions

### 1. New Files

- **`src/utils/circuit_breaker.rs`** - Circuit breaker implementation
- **`src/utils/mod.rs`** - Utilities module
- **`src/actors/coordinator.rs`** - Coordinator actor for supervision
- **`src/actors/health_check.rs`** - Health check actor for monitoring
- **`PHASE4_CHANGES.md`** - This file

### 2. Modified Files

- **`src/messaging/redpanda.rs`** - Now uses circuit breaker for fault tolerance
- **`src/actors/mod.rs`** - Exports new Phase 4 actors
- **`src/main.rs`** - Uses CoordinatorActor instead of starting actors directly
- **`README.md`** - Updated with Phase 4 architecture and features

## What You Get

### New Components

#### 1. Circuit Breaker Pattern

Protects against cascading failures when Redpanda is unavailable:

```rust
// src/utils/circuit_breaker.rs
pub enum CircuitState {
    Closed,     // Normal operation
    Open,       // Blocking requests
    HalfOpen,   // Testing recovery
}
```

**How it works:**
- Tracks failures to Redpanda
- Opens circuit after 5 consecutive failures
- Blocks requests while open (30s timeout)
- Attempts recovery in half-open state
- Closes after 3 successful requests

#### 2. Coordinator Actor

Supervises all child actors with proper lifecycle management:

```rust
// Actor Hierarchy
CoordinatorActor (Supervisor)
├── OrderActor
├── CdcProcessor
└── HealthCheckActor
```

**Responsibilities:**
- Starts and manages child actors
- Coordinates graceful shutdown
- Provides access to child actors
- Implements supervision strategy

#### 3. Health Check Actor

Monitors system health continuously:

```rust
pub enum HealthStatus {
    Healthy,
    Degraded(String),
    Unhealthy(String),
}
```

**Features:**
- Tracks health of all components
- Monitors circuit breaker state
- Periodic health checks (every 10s)
- Aggregates system-wide health
- Reports degraded states

### Benefits

| Feature | Before (Phase 3) | After (Phase 4) | Benefit |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Actor Management** | Manual start/stop | Supervised hierarchy | Better fault isolation |
| **Failure Handling** | Crashes propagate | Circuit breaker protects | Prevents cascading failures |
| **Health Monitoring** | None | Active monitoring | Early problem detection |
| **Shutdown** | Abrupt termination | Graceful shutdown | Clean resource cleanup |
| **Resilience** | Basic | Production-grade | Handles transient failures |

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Phase 3)

```rust
// main.rs - Direct actor initialization
let order_actor = OrderActor::new(session).start();
let cdc_processor = CdcProcessor::new(session, redpanda).start();

// No supervision, no coordination
```

### After (Phase 4)

```rust
// main.rs - Coordinated supervision
let coordinator = CoordinatorActor::new(session, redpanda).start();

// Get supervised actors from coordinator
let order_actor = coordinator.send(GetOrderActor).await?;

// Coordinator manages lifecycle
```

## Circuit Breaker in Action

### Normal Operation (Closed)

```
Request → Circuit Breaker (Closed) → Redpanda
                                        ↓
                                     Success
```

### After Failures (Open)

```
Request → Circuit Breaker (Open) → ❌ Blocked
                                   "Circuit Open"
```

### Recovery (Half-Open)

```
Request → Circuit Breaker (HalfOpen) → Redpanda
                                          ↓
                                       Success
                                          ↓
                                   Closed (recovered)
```

### Configuration

```rust
CircuitBreakerConfig {
    failure_threshold: 5,           // Open after 5 failures
    timeout: Duration::from_secs(30), // Wait 30s before retry
    success_threshold: 3,           // Need 3 successes to close
}
```

## Health Monitoring

### System Health Check

```rust
// Get overall system health
let health = health_check_actor.send(GetSystemHealth).await?;

match health.overall_status {
    HealthStatus::Healthy => {
        // All components operating normally
    }
    HealthStatus::Degraded(msg) => {
        // Some components having issues
        warn!("System degraded: {}", msg);
    }
    HealthStatus::Unhealthy(msg) => {
        // Critical issues detected
        error!("System unhealthy: {}", msg);
    }
}
```

### Component Health

The health check actor tracks:
- **Redpanda**: Circuit breaker state
- **OrderActor**: Startup status
- **CdcProcessor**: Startup status

### Periodic Checks

- Health checks run every 10 seconds
- System health aggregated every 30 seconds
- Automatic logging of health changes

## Graceful Shutdown

### Before (Phase 3)

```rust
// Abrupt termination
Ctrl+C → Process killed → Actors stopped immediately
```

### After (Phase 4)

```rust
// Graceful shutdown sequence
Ctrl+C → Coordinator.send(Shutdown)
      ↓
      Coordinator stops child actors
      ↓
      OrderActor stops
      ↓
      CdcProcessor stops
      ↓
      HealthCheck stops
      ↓
      Coordinator stops
      ↓
      Clean exit
```

## Code Examples

### Using the Circuit Breaker

```rust
// Automatically protected by circuit breaker
let result = redpanda.publish("topic", "key", "payload").await;

match result {
    Ok(_) => {
        // Success - circuit remains closed
    }
    Err(e) if e.to_string().contains("Circuit breaker open") => {
        // Circuit open - Redpanda temporarily unavailable
        // Will retry after timeout
    }
    Err(e) => {
        // Other error - circuit will track this failure
    }
}
```

### Accessing Child Actors

```rust
// Get order actor from coordinator
let order_actor = coordinator
    .send(GetOrderActor)
    .await?
    .expect("Order actor should be available");

// Use order actor
order_actor.send(CreateOrder { ... }).await?;
```

### Monitoring Health

```rust
// Get health check actor
let health_actor = coordinator
    .send(GetHealthCheckActor)
    .await?
    .expect("Health check actor should be available");

// Check system health
let health = health_actor.send(GetSystemHealth).await?;
println!("System status: {:?}", health.overall_status);
```

## Observing Phase 4 in Action

### Logs You'll See

**Startup:**
```
🎯 CoordinatorActor started - Phase 4: Actor Supervision
Starting supervised child actors
OrderActor started
CdcProcessor started
HealthCheckActor started
✅ All supervised actors started successfully
```

**Health Checks:**
```
System health check: Healthy
Updated component health component=redpanda status=Healthy
```

**Circuit Breaker:**
```
Circuit breaker opening after 5 failures
Circuit breaker transitioning to HalfOpen
Circuit breaker closing after 3 successes
```

**Shutdown:**
```
🛑 CoordinatorActor stopping - initiating graceful shutdown
OrderActor received stop signal
CdcProcessor received stop signal
HealthCheckActor received stop signal
🛑 CoordinatorActor stopped
```

## Testing Circuit Breaker

### Simulate Redpanda Failure

```bash
# Stop Redpanda
docker-compose stop redpanda

# Watch the logs - you'll see:
# - Initial failures
# - Circuit opening after 5 failures
# - Subsequent requests blocked immediately
# - "Circuit breaker open" errors

# Restart Redpanda
docker-compose start redpanda

# Watch recovery:
# - Circuit transitions to half-open after 30s
# - Test requests sent
# - Circuit closes after 3 successes
```

## Testing Health Monitoring

```bash
# Run the application
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run

# Observe periodic health checks in logs
# Every 10 seconds:
# "Updated component health"

# Every 30 seconds:
# "System health check: Healthy"
```

## Supervision Benefits

### Fault Isolation

Actors are isolated - failure in one doesn't crash others:

```
OrderActor crashes → Coordinator detects
                   → Can restart OrderActor
                   → CDC and Health continue running
```

### Clean Lifecycle

Coordinator manages the full lifecycle:

```
Start → Initialize → Running → Shutdown → Cleanup
  ↓         ↓          ↓          ↓          ↓
Create   Configure  Process   Stop       Release
Actors    Actors    Messages  Actors    Resources
```

### Resource Management

Proper cleanup on shutdown:

```
Coordinator.stop()
├─ OrderActor.stop() → Close DB connections
├─ CdcProcessor.stop() → Stop CDC reader
└─ HealthCheck.stop() → Stop monitoring
```

## Configuration Options

### Circuit Breaker

Adjust in `src/messaging/redpanda.rs`:

```rust
CircuitBreakerConfig {
    failure_threshold: 5,    // Increase for more tolerance
    timeout: Duration::from_secs(30),  // Adjust recovery time
    success_threshold: 3,    // Adjust confirmation needed
}
```

### Health Checks

Adjust intervals in actors:

```rust
// Health check frequency (src/actors/health_check.rs)
ctx.run_interval(Duration::from_secs(10), ...);

// System health aggregation (src/actors/coordinator.rs)
ctx.run_interval(Duration::from_secs(30), ...);
```

## Comparison with Phase 3

| Aspect | Phase 3 | Phase 4 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Actor Lifecycle** | Manual | Supervised |
| **Failure Handling** | Crash and log | Circuit breaker |
| **Health Monitoring** | None | Active monitoring |
| **Shutdown** | Abrupt | Graceful |
| **Resilience** | Basic retry | Circuit breaker + supervision |
| **Observability** | Logs only | Health checks + logs |
| **Production Ready** | Good | Excellent |

## Production Readiness Checklist

✅ **Supervision** - Coordinator manages actor lifecycle
✅ **Circuit Breaker** - Protects against downstream failures
✅ **Health Monitoring** - Active health checks
✅ **Graceful Shutdown** - Clean resource cleanup
✅ **Error Handling** - Comprehensive error tracking
✅ **Logging** - Structured logging with context

## Next Steps

Phase 4 is complete! The system now has production-grade fault tolerance and monitoring.

Potential Phase 5 additions:
- Dead Letter Queue for failed messages
- Metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Distributed tracing
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Rate limiting

## Troubleshooting

### Circuit Breaker Stuck Open

```rust
// Manually reset if needed
redpanda.reset_circuit_breaker().await;
```

### Health Check Not Reporting

Check logs for:
```
HealthCheckActor started
```

If missing, coordinator may not have started properly.

### Actors Not Stopping Gracefully

Increase shutdown timeout or check for blocking operations in actors.
